# Integrating into production

It is often desirable to have some form of integration between your component library and your production site or application.

However, each project is different, and each one will have its own set of constraints and requirements that will determine the best way to perform this integration.

Instead of constraining you to a particular approach, Fractal instead exposes a [full-featured API](../../api/) to allow access to its underlying data model and rendering engine. This means that you can include it directly into your application as a dependency, or into your build tools to enable you to export templates, assets or whatever else you need and in the best format to make integration as painless as possible.

There are however some common patterns around this, some of which will be outlined below.
